# Tens-Game(Continued) CHECK TENS-GAME1 Repository First
Hi! Welcome! This is my Java game simulating the card game known as "Tens". 

Due to file size issues, this repo is for the rest of the cards from a 52 deck used for the GUI of the game

Download the cards1 folder and merge them with the cards2 folder found in the Tens-Game1 repo =>name this folder cards

Feel free to use the below link to access an executable jar file of the program. Thanks!
